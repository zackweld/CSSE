Inputs

Body -> Star name
  Mandatory
  Must be a name in stars file

  Not Mandatory
    Default to "2001-01-01"
  Must be in correct format
    "yyyy-mm-dd"
  Year must be greater than or equal to 2001
  Other date info must be valid

Time - Time of observation

  Must be in correct format
    "hh:mm:ss"


Functionality

1. Find angular displacement relative to Aries
  - Find star body in table
  - SHA = SHA from table
  - latitude = declination from table

2. Calculate the Greenwich Hour Angle for the date and time observed
  - Determine angular difference for each year
    Cumulative progression = number of years * -0d14.31667
  - Take into account leap years
    rotation = 86164.2s
    clock = 86400s
    amount of daily rotation = 0d59.0
    total progression = number of leap years * amount of daily rotation
  - Calculate how far the prime meridian has rotated since the beginning of the observation year
    rotation = GHA(2001-01-01) + cumulative progression + Leap progression
  - Calculate the angle of the earth's rotation since the beginning of the observation's year
    Earth rotational period = 86164.1s
    Amount of rotation = number of total seconds / rotational period * 360d.00
  - Calculate Total
    GHA(desired time) = GHA(2001) + rotation in observation year

3. Calculate the star's GHA
  - Let GHA(star) = GHA(Aries) + SHA(star)
  - Clean up by getting angle between 0 and 360
    Round to nearest 0.1 arc minute
  - Add values to dictionary
    "long"
    "lat"
